        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>According to Statistics Canada, one in three Canadians doesn't have proper access to dental care â€” an entire
            1/3rd of our country. This is the idea that inspired our team to make a change.</p>
        <p>WhiteStone is a Machine-learning oral health scanning app that helps individuals who are low-income,
            colorblind, and unable to get to the dentist regularly. The goal of our app is to help people evaluate their
            dental health and reduce the number of necessary dental checkups, as well as provide a dental assistant for
            those who need it.</p>

            <h3>User persona</h3>
            <p>For an app project, user persona is necessary because it helps to understand the target audience's needs,
                preferences, and behaviors, allowing for the creation of a more user-centric and tailored application
                that effectively addresses the specific requirements of the intended users. That's why the team created
                these primary and secondary persona below</p>
